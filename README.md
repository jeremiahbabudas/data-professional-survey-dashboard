# Data Professional Survey Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project is a Power BI dashboard created using survey data from data professionals. The dataset includes responses related to job roles, career transitions, age, preferred programming languages, work-life balance, salary satisfaction, and more.

The Excel dataset (`Power BI - Final Project.xlsx`) was loaded and cleaned within Power BI using Power Query, where necessary columns were transformed and filtered for better visual analysis.

## Dashboard Features

The final dashboard includes the following visuals:

- **Country of survey taker** – Treemap  
- **Favorite programming language** – Stacked column chart  
- **Average job salary by title** – Stacked bar chart  
- **Difficulty breaking into data** – Donut chart  
- **Count of survey takers** – Card  
- **Average age of survey taker** – Card  
- **Happiness with work-life balance** – Gauge  
- **Happiness with salary** – Gauge  

These visuals offer insights into trends and preferences among data professionals across various regions and roles.
